# Accelerometer
Microchip/Bluetooth/Android/IOS/AWS

Overview of the task is shown below, in general I'd expect to see two screen creations.
If there is any ambiguaty please send me an email. Upon completion please raise a pull request against (main) branch.
Application code has been added under com.example.accelerometer.app, would be create to have a test case which launches the application and loads in the signal from the specified file in resources/

Note: appologese, I forgot to add this in the diagram below, the first screen needs an indicator that bluetooth connection as been made, use any form of green/red icon.

I'm not too fussed about the look/graphics of this project, as long as its usable with the current application code and the layout is the same it should be ok.
